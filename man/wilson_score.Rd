\title{Wilson Score Lower Bound for Arbitrary Rating Scale}
\usage{
wilson_score(rating, n, min_score = 1, max_score = 5, conf = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{rating}{Numeric vector of observed ratings}

\item{n}{Numeric vector of number of reviews (same length as rating)}

\item{min_score}{Minimum rating (default = 1)}

\item{max_score}{Maximum rating (default = 5)}

\item{conf}{Confidence level for the interval (default = 0.95)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of Wilson lower bound scores on the original scale
}
\description{
Computes the lower bound of the Wilson confidence interval for a given
rating and number of reviews, adjusting for arbitrary minimum and maximum scores.
}
\examples{
ratings <- c(5, 1.5, 4)
n_reviews <- c(300, 10, 2)
wilson_score(ratings, n_reviews, min_score = 1, max_score = 5)

# With a 0-10 rating scale
ratings2 <- c(8, 3, 5)
n_reviews2 <- c(100, 20, 5)
wilson_score(ratings2, n_reviews2, min_score = 0, max_score = 10)
