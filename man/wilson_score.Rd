\title{Wilson Score Lower Bound for Arbitrary Rating Scales}
\usage{
wilson_score(rating, n, min_score = 1, max_score = 5, conf = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{rating}{Numeric vector of observed ratings}

\item{n}{Numeric vector of number of reviews (same length as \code{rating})}

\item{min_score}{Minimum rating (default = 1)}

\item{max_score}{Maximum rating (default = 5)}

\item{conf}{Confidence level for the interval (default = 0.95)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of Wilson lower bound scores on the original scale
}
\description{
Computes the lower bound of the Wilson confidence interval for a mean rating,
generalized to any rating scale. Instead of using the raw average rating,
this method produces a conservative score that accounts for uncertainty:
items with few reviews get penalized, while high-volume items stay near their
observed average.
}
\section{Why Wilson scoring?}{

Raw averages are unstable when review counts are small.
A feature with a single 5-star rating should not outrank another with
hundreds of reviews averaging 4.8.

Wilson scoring asks a different question:
\emph{"What is the worst reasonable rating this item could have?"}.
The lower bound of the Wilson confidence interval gives a statistically
conservative estimate. Low-review items are pushed downward, while
well-reviewed items remain stable. This makes Wilson a robust way to sort
items by rating while accounting for uncertainty.
}

\section{Formula}{

Ratings are first mapped to [0,1]:
\deqn{ p = \frac{\text{rating} - min\_score}{max\_score - min\_score} }

Let \eqn{n} be the number of reviews and \eqn{z} the Z-value for the
confidence level. The Wilson lower bound is:
\deqn{
\hat{p}_{lower} =
\frac{
  p + \frac{z^2}{2n} - z \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p) + z^2/(4n)}{n}}
}{
  1 + \frac{z^2}{n}
}
}
If \eqn{n = 0}, the score defaults to the bottom of the scale.
Finally, \eqn{\hat{p}_{lower}} is mapped back to the original rating scale.

\examples{
# Example 1: Standard 1–5 rating scale
ratings <- c(5, 2, 4.5, 5)
n_reviews <- c(1, 5, 30, 500)
wilson_score(ratings, n_reviews)

# Example 2: Custom 0–10 scale with neutral prior
ratings2 <- c(10, 7, 2)
n_reviews2 <- c(2, 20, 500)
wilson_score(ratings2, n_reviews2, min_score = 0, max_score = 10)
