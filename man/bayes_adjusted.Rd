\title{Bayesian Adjusted Rating (Beta-Binomial Shrinkage) for Arbitrary Scale}
\usage{
bayes_adjusted(
  rating,
  n,
  min_score = 1,
  max_score = 5,
  prior_mean = (min_score + max_score)/2,
  prior_n = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rating}{Numeric vector of observed ratings}

\item{n}{Numeric vector of number of reviews (same length as rating)}

\item{min_score}{Minimum rating (default = 1)}

\item{max_score}{Maximum rating (default = 5)}

\item{prior_mean}{Prior expected rating on the same scale as `rating`.
Represents the rating you would trust if no reviews were available.
Default is the midpoint of the scale.
Example: on a 1–5 scale, prior_mean = 3.5 represents a neutral prior.}

\item{prior_n}{Prior strength (pseudo-count). Interpreted as the **minimum trusted number of reviews**.
It controls how strongly the prior pulls small-sample ratings toward `prior_mean`.
Ratings based on fewer reviews than `prior_n` are strongly shrunk; ratings with many reviews are minimally affected.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of Bayesian-adjusted ratings on the original scale
}
\description{
Computes a Bayesian shrinkage estimate of a rating, adjusting for
the number of reviews and a prior belief. This is useful because
small numbers of reviews can produce extreme or unreliable average ratings.
}
\details{
The shrinkage estimate is based on a Beta-Binomial model:
\deqn{ \hat{\theta} = \frac{\alpha + r}{\alpha + \beta + n} }
where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{r = p \cdot n} is the number of "successes" (rating converted to [0,1])
  \item \eqn{\alpha = prior\_mean \cdot prior\_n}
  \item \eqn{\beta = (1 - prior\_mean) \cdot prior\_n}
}
}
\examples{
# 1-5 scale
ratings <- c(5, 1.5, 4)
n_reviews <- c(300, 10, 2)
bayes_adjusted(ratings, n_reviews, min_score = 1, max_score = 5)

# 0-10 scale with custom prior
ratings2 <- c(8, 3, 5)
n_reviews2 <- c(100, 20, 5)
bayes_adjusted(ratings2, n_reviews2, min_score = 0, max_score = 10,
               prior_mean = 5, prior_n = 30)
