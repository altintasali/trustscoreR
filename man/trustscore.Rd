\title{Compute Trust Scores (Wilson and Bayesian) for a Dataset}
\usage{
trustscore(
  df,
  feature_col = NULL,
  rating_col = "rating",
  n_col = "n",
  min_score = 1,
  max_score = 5,
  conf = 0.95,
  prior_mean = (min_score + max_score)/2,
  prior_n = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame containing feature/entity, rating, and review count columns}

\item{feature_col}{Name of the column containing feature/entity names (optional, default = NULL)}

\item{rating_col}{Name of the column containing ratings (default = "rating")}

\item{n_col}{Name of the column containing number of reviews (default = "n")}

\item{min_score}{Minimum rating (default = 1)}

\item{max_score}{Maximum rating (default = 5)}

\item{conf}{Confidence level for Wilson score (default = 0.95)}

\item{prior_mean}{Prior expected rating for Bayesian adjustment (default = midpoint)
Represents the rating you would trust if no reviews were available.
Example: on a 1–5 scale, prior_mean = 3.5 represents a neutral prior.}

\item{prior_n}{Prior strength (pseudo-count / minimum trusted reviews, default = 20)
Controls how strongly the prior pulls small-sample ratings toward `prior_mean`.
Ratings based on fewer reviews than `prior_n` are strongly shrunk;
ratings with many reviews are minimally affected.}
}
\value{
Data frame with added columns:
  \item{wilson}{Wilson lower bound score}
  \item{bayes}{Bayesian-adjusted rating}
}
\description{
Computes both Wilson score lower bounds and Bayesian-adjusted ratings
for a dataset of ratings and review counts, supporting arbitrary scales.
}
\details{
The function adds two columns:
\itemize{
  \item `wilson`: Wilson score lower bound (based on `rating` and `n`)
  \item `bayes`: Bayesian-adjusted rating (uses `prior_mean` and `prior_n`)
}

**Note:** `prior_mean` and `prior_n` are used only for the Bayesian adjustment.
`wilson` scores are computed independently of these parameters.

df <- data.frame(
  company = c("A", "B", "C"),
  stars = c(5, 1.5, 4),
  votes = c(300, 10, 2)
)
trustscore(df, feature_col = "company", rating_col = "stars", n_col = "votes")

# Custom 0-10 scale and prior
df2 <- data.frame(
  company = c("X", "Y", "Z"),
  score = c(8, 3, 5),
  reviews = c(100, 20, 5)
)
trustscore(df2, feature_col = "company", rating_col = "score", n_col = "reviews",
           min_score = 0, max_score = 10, prior_mean = 5, prior_n = 30)
